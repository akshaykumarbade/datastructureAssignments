# datastructureAssignments
1. Complete the implementation Singly linked list class (SList.java) by implementing DeleteFirstNode() and DeleteLastNode() functions.
Refer to today's class pdf for the algorithms explaination.

2. Implement a stack class that implements the following interface.
interface StackIntf {
	public void Push(int element);
	public int Pop();
	public boolean IsEmpty();
	public boolean IsFull();
}
The stack implementation should use singly linked list to store the stack data.
Use the singly linked list class implemented above for the same.
Refer to today's class pdf for the explanation.
